What's it gonna take to get ahead?
Do I better my chances if, if I stand up straight?
Open up my lungs, breathe the winning air
"I only tell it like it is, and fair is fair"

Aah
Aah
Aah

And when they're staring at you, "what you gonna do now?"
Big question in the background, you seeing them coming around
See 'em coming around, see 'em coming around
See 'em coming around, see 'em coming around

Aah
Aah
Aah

Upright, upright, upright, upright
Upright, upright, upright, upright
Upright, upright, upright, upright
Upright, upright, upright, upright

You can meet your goals in record time
Make good connections
And align your spine (Stick your chest out)
Visualize the future (Don't stick your neck out)
And it will realise (Don't let this opportunity pass you by)
