You broke my heart to save a one true chance
To grow old year by year, Ever we're dancing
The way the summer's like without al lthe rain
Can rely on me honey. I'll always remain
Your confident you know your my best friend
Your The thoughts on my mind I can't comprehend.
Like you don't even need to live so departed
Forever you're the only one that in my heart

(Ch)

Lay on the ceiling stare up of at the floor
Fall upstairs to answer quiet knocks on my back door
There's water in the streets and roots on the sky
Wind blows my way you know I'm up all night
The earth is spinning less than by your side
One day together babe we gone flip the world upright, Gonna flip the world upright

(V2)

Your speedin from me baby don't you drive slow
I'll be here waitin in the place that you know
Just hangin windows and no one knows my name
And now that your gone I'm the only one to blame
From heart to heart I wish your shortening breath
These understood tears that them blue eyes wept
Seeping through the cracks and caught in the ground
And slowly but surely tip the world upside down.

Don't deny it in your diary, I saw you wrote that you still loved me
The ending of the words have all been erased, fifth line, third base.
You wanna see me as I do you, I wish you felt the way you used to.
And I can tell you its coming soon, it's coming soon.
