You have this life, what for?
Tell me.
Spend it on shit, your
ignorance appals me.
You serve me your morals,
changed for a fiver,
Upright citizen, Penthouse
subscriber.
You won't print the word, but
you'll beat up the wife,
In your ignorant, arrogant,
terminal life.
You have this life, you deprive
me of mine,
With your twisted, imbalanced
idea of sin.
That revolves around money; how
much are you bought for?
A tenner, a fiver, is that what
you're caught for?
I'm sick of your pride, you
think you can rule me,
With crappy judgement from your
respectable majority.
Majority of what? You self
oppressed idiot,
I'm not going to carry you, I'm
no compatriot.
How many times do I excuse and
forgive
The damage inflicted by the way
that you live?
I hold my vision against your
oppression,
Your final defence, your only
possession.
I'll show you the blood, but
you'll still point the gun,
If the money's enough, or can
you show you're a man?
To your submissive wife,
desperate whore,
Home loving, mothering,
stifling bore.
You have this life, you twist
and abuse it,
Morals and money and media
controls it.
Can't you see the dead
children, blood in the street?
Every fist that you raise is a
corpse at your feet.
Every time you are bought, I
don't care the amount,
You are the rapist, dealing in
death count.
And you do this with mercenary
morals, you shit,
Oh, you've been told about
dignity down in the pit.
Respectable working man,
honourable wife?
A waste of energy and an insult
to life.
