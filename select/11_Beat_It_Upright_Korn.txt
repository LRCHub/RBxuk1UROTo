Are you ready for a good pounding baby?
Get down
Are you ready to get it on?
Get down, get down
Don't pretend you're not fuckin' freaky baby
Get down
I will spank that ass just for fun
Get down on the ground

Ass up high
Make a muthafu-cker cry
It's so good that I could die
Help me stay alive

The time is right
I wanna feel if you're tight
I'm down to do this all night
I'm gonna beat it up right

I'll behave
Oh my god
Make me beg
My god

Yes I'm ready for a good flogging baby
My god
Come on beat my ass just for fun
Get down, get down
Don't let up till my ass is bleeding baby
Get down
Don't let up until you are done
Get down, on the ground

Ass up high
Make a muthafu-cker cry
It's so good that I could die
Help me stay alive

The time is right
I wanna feel if you're tight
I'm down to do this all night
I'm gonna beat it up right

We're going on a ride
I'm gonna turn you inside out, upside down
Don't try to run and hide
Yes it's true what they say about my kind

Are you ready for a good pounding baby?
Get down
Are you ready to get it on?
Get down, get down
Don't pretend you're not fuckin' freaky baby
Get down
I will spank that ass just for fun
Get down, on the ground

Ass up high
Make a muthafu-cker cry
It's so good that I could die
Help me stay alive

The time is right
I wanna feel if you're tight
I'm down to do this all night
I'm gonna beat it up right
