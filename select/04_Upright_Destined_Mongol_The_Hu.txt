Since the Hun empire, the world trembled with the legendary history
With ancestors who thrived worshiping the sacred mountain Khaldun
The mighty steppe horsemen dwelling in wool felt yurts
Glorious, noble, and chosen by Tengri

Above us
Upright blue sky
Upright blue Mongol
Upright tale of history
Mongol of Eternal Tengri

As long as our language, borders, and livestock exist
Who is wealthy, Mongol is wealthy
As long as our language, borders, and livestock exist
Who is wealthy, Mongol is wealthy

Khudan Mongol script is of wise Tengri
Two stringed Morin Khuur is of melodious Tengri
Capable vigorous men are of mighty Tengri
Wise queens with rosy cheeks are of noble Tengri

Above us
Upright blue sky
Upright blue Mongol
Born into upright destiny
Mongol with the blue seal, hu hu

As long as our language, borders, and livestock exist
Who is wealthy, Mongol is wealthy
As long as our language, borders, and livestock exist
Who is wealthy, Mongol is wealthy

Wolves howling to the crescent moon are of Eternal Tengri
Falcons fawn colored as the sun are of windy Tengri
Audacious fast steeds are of glorious Tengri
Thunderous Black Banner is of wrathful Tengri

Above us
Upright Blue Tengri
Upright Blue Mongol
Upright steed reverence
Black Bannered Mongol Hu Hu

As long as our language, borders, and livestock exist
Who is wealthy, Mongol is wealthy
