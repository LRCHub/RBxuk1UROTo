Looking at your skin
Smooth as silk
A shiver inside of me
Touchin' your hair
Black cloud
You know I'll visit your lair
There's a delight in their eyes
When I tear up the dress and squeeze
All the laces
On the wrists
Babe tell me you feel pain

Licking the tears from the face I'm coming down
Honey and sugar from the upright smile I've found.

Fire! You know my body is on fire!
Fire! Is burning inside my desire!

I stop the dance tongue
Astonished
You look at me so surprised
Sceptre's ready
Is the password
Turn yourself howling ahh
Panting wild beast here I am
You like to be ridden on
But you're master
And I slave
And the game is just ended again

Nothing more than big vibrator for your delights
But the cage is waiting for me, is this life?
